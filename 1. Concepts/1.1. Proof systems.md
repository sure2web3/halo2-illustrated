# Proof systems

The aim of any ***proof system*** is to be able to prove interesting mathematical or
cryptographic ***statements***.

Typically, in a given protocol we will want to prove families of statements that differ
in their ***public inputs***. The prover will also need to show that they know some
***private inputs*** that make the statement hold.

To do this we write down a ***relation***, $\mathcal{R}$, that specifies which
combinations of public and private inputs are valid.
```

|   Private Inputs  |       |   Public Inputs   |

| Term         | Description  |
|--------------|--------------|
| circuit | To be precise, we should distinguish between the relation $\mathcal{R}$, and its implementation to be used in a proof system. We call the latter a ***circuit***. | 
| arithmetization | The language that we use to express circuits for a particular proof system is called an ***arithmetization***. Usually, an arithmetization will define circuits in terms of polynomial constraints on variables over a field. |


> The _process_ of expressing a particular relation as a circuit is also sometimes called
> "arithmetization", but we'll avoid that usage.

To create a proof of a statement, the prover will need to know the private inputs,
and also intermediate values, called ***advice*** values, that are used by the circuit.

We assume that we can compute advice values efficiently from the private and public inputs.
The particular advice values will depend on how we write the circuit, not only on the
high-level statement.

The private inputs and advice values are collectively called a ***witness***.

> Some authors use "witness" as just a synonym for private inputs. But in our usage,
> a witness includes advice, i.e. it includes all values that the prover supplies to
> the circuit.

For example, suppose that we want to prove knowledge of a preimage $x$ of a
hash function $H$ for a digest $y$:

* The private input would be the preimage $x$.

* The public input would be the digest $y$.

* The relation would be $\{(x, y) : H(x) = y\}$.

* For a particular public input $Y$, the statement would be: $\{(x) : H(x) = Y\}$.

* The advice would be all of the intermediate values in the circuit implementing the
  hash function. The witness would be $x$ and the advice.

If $H$ is a cryptographic hash function like SHA-256, the intermediate values could include:
| example | description |
| ---------| ----------- |
| The results of compression functions. | These are the intermediate outputs produced by the compression function used in the hash function. A compression function takes a fixed-size input (e.g., a block of data and a chaining value) and produces a smaller fixed-size output. In cryptographic hash functions like SHA-256, the compression function is applied iteratively to process the input data in chunks. |
| The outputs of modular additions or bitwise operations. | These are the intermediate results of arithmetic operations (like modular addition) or logical operations (like AND, OR, XOR, etc.) performed during the computation of the hash function. For example, in SHA-256, modular additions are used to combine intermediate values, and bitwise operations are used to manipulate data at the binary level. |
| The state of the hash function at each round of computation. | This refers to the internal state of the hash function after each round of processing. Cryptographic hash functions typically operate in multiple rounds, where each round updates the state based on the input and the previous state. For instance, in SHA-256, the state consists of 8 words (registers) that are updated in each of the 64 rounds of the algorithm. |

A ***Non-interactive Argument*** allows a ***prover*** to create a ***proof*** for a
given statement and witness. The proof is data that can be used to convince a ***verifier***
that _there exists_ a witness for which the statement holds. The security property that
such proofs cannot falsely convince a verifier is called ***soundness***.

A ***Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge*** (***NARK***) further convinces the verifier
that the prover _knew_ a witness for which the statement holds. This security property is
called ***knowledge soundness***, and it implies soundness.

In practice knowledge soundness is more useful for cryptographic protocols than soundness:
if we are interested in whether Alice holds a secret key in some protocol, say, we need
Alice to prove that _she knows_ the key, not just that it exists.

| **Property**          | **Soundness**                                                                 | **Knowledge Soundness**                                                                                     |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**         | Ensures that a proof cannot falsely convince a verifier that a statement is true. | Ensures that the prover not only convinces the verifier that the statement is true but also that they know the witness. |
| **Focus**             | Validity of the statement.                                                   | Prover's knowledge of the witness.                                                                          |
| **Example**           | Verifying that a secret key exists.                                          | Verifying that the prover knows the secret key.                                                             |
| **Security Property** | Prevents false proofs from being accepted.                                   | Prevents proofs from being generated without knowledge of the witness.                                      |
| **Use Case**          | General correctness of proofs.                                               | Cryptographic protocols where the prover must demonstrate knowledge (e.g., proving ownership of a secret key). |

Knowledge soundness is formalized by saying that an ***extractor***, which can observe
precisely how the proof is generated, must be able to compute the witness.

This is formalized by introducing an extractor, which is a hypothetical algorithm or entity that can observe the exact process by which the proof is generated. The extractor must be able to reconstruct or compute the witness (the private inputs and advice values) based on this observation.

| Key Point | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Extractor's Role | a. The extractor acts as a verifier with additional capabilities, such as observing the internal workings of the prover during proof generation.<br> b. It ensures that the prover genuinely knows the witness and is not simply fabricating a valid proof without knowledge of the required inputs. |
| Guarantee | If the extractor can compute the witness from the proof generation process, it guarantees that the prover had knowledge of the witness when creating the proof. | 
| Importance | This property is crucial in cryptographic protocols where proving knowledge (e.g., of a secret key) is more important than merely proving the existence of a valid witness. |

> This property is subtle given that proofs can be ***malleable***. That is, depending on the
> proof system it may be possible to take an existing proof (or set of proofs) and, without
> knowing the witness(es), modify it/them to produce a distinct proof of the same or a related
> statement. Higher-level protocols that use malleable proof systems need to take this into
> account.
>
> Even without malleability, proofs can also potentially be ***replayed***. For instance,
> we would not want Alice in our example to be able to present a proof generated by someone
> else, and have that be taken as a demonstration that she knew the key.

Replayability can be addressed by ensuring that proofs are unique to the prover and the specific instance of the protocol. Techniques include:
| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Incorporating Nonces | Include a unique, random value (nonce) in the proof generation process. This ensures that each proof is unique and cannot be reused in a different context. | 
| Challenge-Response Protocols | Use an interactive challenge-response mechanism where the verifier provides a random challenge that the prover must respond to. This ensures that the proof is tied to the specific interaction and cannot be replayed. | 
| Binding Proofs to the Prover | Include information specific to the prover (e.g., a public key or identity) in the proof. This ensures that the proof cannot be reused by another party. |

If a proof yields no information about the witness (other than that a witness exists and was
known to the prover), then we say that the proof system is ***zero knowledge***.

If a proof system produces short proofs —i.e. of length polylogarithmic in the circuit
size— then we say that it is ***succinct***. A succinct NARK is called a ***SNARK***
(***Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge***).

Polylogarithmic refers to a mathematical function that grows proportionally to a polynomial of the logarithm of its input size. In other words, a function ( $f(n)$ ) is polylogarithmic if it can be expressed as: $[ f(n) = (\log n)^k ]$, where ( $\log n$ ) is the logarithm of ( $n$ ), and ( $k$ ) is a constant (a non-negative integer or real number).
| Key Characteristic | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Growth Rate | a. Polylogarithmic functions grow much slower than polynomial functions (e.g., ( $n^k$ )) as ( $n$ ) increases.<br> b. For example, ( $\log^2 n$ ) (a polylogarithmic function) grows slower than ( $n$ ) or ( $n^2$ ). | 
| Examples | ( $\log n$ ): Logarithmic growth.<br> ( $(\log n)^2$ ): Quadratic polylogarithmic growth.<br> ( $(\log n)^k$ ): General polylogarithmic growth for any constant ( $k$ ). |
| Relevance in Proof Systems | a. In the context of proof systems, polylogarithmic length means that the size of the proof grows very slowly relative to the size of the circuit being proven.<br> b. This property is desirable because it ensures that proofs remain compact and efficient, even for large circuits. |

> By this definition, a SNARK need not have verification time polylogarithmic in the circuit
> size. Some papers use the term ***efficient*** to describe a SNARK with that property, but
> we'll avoid that term since it's ambiguous for SNARKs that support amortized or recursive
> verification, which we'll get to later.

A ***zk-SNARK*** is a zero-knowledge SNARK.
